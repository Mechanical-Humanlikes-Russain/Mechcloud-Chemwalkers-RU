        <discoveredLetterTitle>About: Mechcloud Chemwalkers</discoveredLetterTitle>
        <discoveredLetterText>You now have the knowledge necessary to create suits of armor that can be animated and imbued with power to serve you - but it requires several steps to get started. There are four steps to bringing a mechcloud chemwalker to animate existence:\n- Crafting the suit of armor at a fueled smithy.\n- Inscribing the armor with sigils of power at an art bench.\n- Allowing the armor to accumulate mechanites from the environment - ideally nearby an anima tree and away from artificial structures that may lure mechanites elsewhere.\n- Attuning the empowered armor to the will of a psycaster who will command it to serve for all time.</discoveredLetterText>
